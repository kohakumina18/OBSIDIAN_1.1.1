# Integration Specification

## Integration Status

Current Working Document

## Known Systems and Dependencies

- Systems: WFX, allocation data, transfer/borrow cases, validation rules.
- Dependencies: Needs Confirmation

## Required Integration Contract

| Area | Requirement | Current Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | Define approved event, schedule or user action | Needs Confirmation |
| API / Service | Use approved API or service boundary | Needs Confirmation |
| Validation | Validate identity, input, state and business rules | Needs Confirmation |
| Idempotency | Prevent duplicate processing where transactions are involved | Required |
| Approval | Define human/system approval boundary | Needs Confirmation |
| Rollback | Define safe reversal or compensation | Required |
| Exception Handling | Log, route and retry only through approved behavior | Needs Confirmation |
| Audit Log | Retain request, result, actor, timestamp and status | Required |
| Fallback | Preserve approved manual or support path | Needs Confirmation |

## Transaction Safety Rule

A direct database write is not assumed to update a transactional system. WFX changes require an approved API or vendor-supported transactional service.
