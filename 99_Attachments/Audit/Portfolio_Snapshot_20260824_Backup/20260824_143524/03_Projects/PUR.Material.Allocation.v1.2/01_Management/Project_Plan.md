## Current State - 2026-08-24

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical Code | PUR.Material.Allocation.v1.1 |
| Domain | Sourcing / Purchasing |
| Delivery Stage | UAT / PRE-GO-LIVE |
| Lifecycle | First Flow Validated |
| Status | Active |
| Progress | TBD |
| Gate | Exception, rollback and transaction-safety testing |
| Priority | P7 |
| Outcome | Validate controlled reallocation of surplus NPL across eligible OCs. |
| Source Event | PPJ-PORTFOLIO-SNAPSHOT-20260824 |

### Latest Update

The first Sewing/Embroidery flow was validated: surplus OC -> unreserve -> find same Style/Buyer Reference OC -> allocate. General automation is not fully validated.

### Current Risks

- Partial-allocation correctness
- Rollback and duplicate safety
- WFX transaction consistency

### Dependencies

- None recorded in the current portfolio snapshot.

### Next Actions

- Test multiple OCs and partial allocation
- Test insufficient stock, duplicates and failure paths
- Validate rollback, audit and user confirmation

# Project Plan

## Planning Basis

- Lifecycle: UAT / Stabilization
- Current gate: First Flow Validated / Extended Exception Testing
- Priority: TBD
- Plan status: Current Working Document

## Current Work Packages

1. Confirm scope, ownership and evidence.
2. Complete the current lifecycle gate.
3. Maintain task, risk, decision and dependency traceability.
4. Prepare only the next approved delivery or closeout step.

## Evidence-Based Next Actions

- Test many-to-one, one-to-many, partial allocation, insufficient quantity, Buyer Reference mismatch and duplicate allocation.
- Test transaction failure/retry and define rollback.
- Define audit log and user review before posting.
- Prepare UAT with Ms. Tuyet and Precision users.

## Dependencies

- Needs Confirmation

## Planning Controls

- No unapproved scope expansion.
- No invented owner, date, source table or business rule.
- Each milestone requires evidence and responsible-owner confirmation.

## Evidence Basis
