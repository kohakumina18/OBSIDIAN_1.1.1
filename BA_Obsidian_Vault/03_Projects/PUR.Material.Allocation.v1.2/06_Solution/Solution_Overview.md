# Solution Overview

## Purpose

Validated unreserve, destination-OC matching and allocation flow with controlled UAT foundation

## Current Solution Boundary

- Project type: Transaction Automation
- Known systems: WFX, allocation data, transfer/borrow cases, validation rules.
- Current gate: First Flow Validated / Extended Exception Testing

## Logical Flow

Approved Input -> Validation -> Approved Service / Data Processing -> Business Review -> Output -> Logging and Evidence

## Non-Assumptions

- No direct transactional database write is assumed.
- No unconfirmed API, table, model, device or vendor capability is treated as implemented.
- WFX, Databricks and Data Warehouse responsibilities remain separate.

## Evidence Basis

- Root project note: [[../PUR.Material.Allocation.v1.2]]
- Project memory: [[03_Projects/_Registry/Project_Memory/PUR.Material.Allocation.v1.1.memory]]
