# Project Plan

## Planning Basis

- Lifecycle: Analysis / Solution Redesign
- Current gate: Business Flow Confirmed / API Integration Discovery
- Priority: P2
- Plan status: Current Working Document

## Current Work Packages

1. Confirm scope, ownership and evidence.
2. Complete the current lifecycle gate.
3. Maintain task, risk, decision and dependency traceability.
4. Prepare only the next approved delivery or closeout step.

## Evidence-Based Next Actions

- Request WFX API documentation and supported create/update/draft/submit/cancel/status operations.
- Confirm authentication, request/response schema, idempotency and duplicate rules.
- Confirm rollback, audit and approval-before-submit requirements.
- Build and test an API prototype in a non-production environment.
- Do not write production transactions without vendor approval.

## Dependencies

- Confirmed Purchasing Workflow -> WFX API -> Controlled GDI Transaction -> Audit and Status

## Planning Controls

- No unapproved scope expansion.
- No invented owner, date, source table or business rule.
- Each milestone requires evidence and responsible-owner confirmation.

## Evidence Basis

- Root project note: [[../PUR.GDI Automation]]
- Project memory: [[03_Projects/_Registry/Project_Memory/PUR.GDI.Automation.v1.0.memory]]
